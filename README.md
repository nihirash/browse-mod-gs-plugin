# GeneralSound .MOD player for Bob Fossil's esxDOS file browser

## Usage

Get file from releases page and put it to `/bin/bplugins` directory - execute this browser and tap on some mod - when it will be loaded - it will play in background.

You can continue your work without any issues and listen great music.

It's very simple plugin. But usefull.

## Development

To compile project all you need is [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus).

I'm also using GNU Make but if you call `sjasmplus` for `mod.asm`
